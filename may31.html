    I’ve really been taken by the idea of some solitary text — a word, at most a phrase — ensconced in the real world, 
    (that dimension it is supposed to be a translating vehicle for) semantically unhooked.

    At some point, it becomes impossible for one to look at a word and not immediately imbue it with meaning. 
    I wonder what happens when you return a word into its base, visual parts  — curvature, color, contrast — or if you can at all.

    Because my research is in computational linguistics, I’ve become unable not to think of words in terms of their contexts. 
    Current NLP takes the "distributional hypothesis" writ large (to blinding success), the theory that says a word's meaning is 
    defined by the environments it appears in. "You shall know a word by the company it keeps" (Firth 1957). This was put into use originally 
    with word co-occurence rates-- people counted which words appeared together, and turned these distributions into vectors; so meaning became
    spatial -- words that are similar to each other have similar vectors.

    The (relatively) recent vast developments with NLP (the world before ChatGPT) were catalyzed by the transformers architecture, which 
    uses an 'attention mechanism' (you may have heard of references to the ubiquitous 'Attention is All You Need' paper), which goes beyond 
    word co-occurrences, it also weighs how important each word in a sentence is.

      Theoretically, this is directly opposed to formal semantics side (spearheaded by Noam Chomsky), which says that argues 
    that words refer to something objective and true a priori. Distributional semantics argues that a words meaning is how it exists, not before. 
    I've been studying computational linguistics since 2021; so I've seen how rapidly the field has changed. The distributional semantics proponents are, at the very least... kind of right.

      The concept of a word’s context not being other words — but the experience of seeing it, something unquantifiable, is very striking to me.
      I'm not sure why, exactly — maybe its the fact that the text is so far removed from what it was /meant/ to do - lost over space and time. 
      But when I find these scenes, they made me pause nonetheless, to try to unearth meaning (I wonder who left it here? I wonder what kind of person this means something else to? I wonder in which system is this sign defined?)

        And there's something very satisfying and moving about this to me -- cases where meaning is subsumed by context — the horizon, the treeline, the creeping vine, the rust and cracks.
